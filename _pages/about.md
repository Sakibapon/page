## About Me

I am a PhD Student at the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/), working in the field of AI and Machine Learning. Previously, I completed my MSc at the [University of Maine](https://www.maine.edu/) and was appointed as a Researcher at [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/).

My research focuses on general AI & Machine Learning. I use various statistical data science technologies such as machine learning and deep learning to solve issues in the field of Autonomous systems, Edge Computing, Computer Vision/Graphics, and interpretable machine learning.

I obtained my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, where I developed a methodological toolkit to understand complex problems with applications across multiple domains.
