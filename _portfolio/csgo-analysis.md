## Key Features

- Uses five different transfer learning models with majority voting
- Self-developed deep neural network model for video analysis
- System API allows automated collection and processing of data
- Enhances system performance through continuous training

## Technologies Used

- Transfer Learning (5 different models)
- Majority Voting
- Deep Neural Networks
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras
- API Development
