## Project Overview

This project develops an efficient CNN model for optical coherence tomography (OCT) disease classification with explainable AI capabilities.

## Key Features

- CNN model identifies OCT diseases in four classes
- Significantly smaller model size, suitable for web app deployment
- Real-time OCT diagnostic classification
- Memory-efficient implementation
- Uses LIME & Grad-CAM for model interpretability

## Technologies Used

- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Explainable AI (LIME, Grad-CAM)
- Transfer Learning
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras
